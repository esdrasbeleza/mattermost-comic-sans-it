# Comic Sans it!

A plugin for Mattermost to use Comic Sans in its UI, based on the [plugin  starter template](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-starter-template).

Build  plugin:
```
make
```

This will produce a single plugin file (with support for multiple architectures) for upload to your Mattermost server:

```
dist/com.example.my-plugin.tar.gz
```

There is a build target to automate deploying and enabling the plugin to your server, but it requires login credentials:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or configuration of a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```

Alternatively, if you are running your `mattermost-server` out of a sibling directory by the same name, use the `deploy` target alone to  unpack the files into the right directory. You will need to restart your server and manually enable your plugin.

In production, deploy and upload your plugin via the [System Console](https://about.mattermost.com/default-plugin-uploads).
